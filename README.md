# Big Data Guys

This is the description for a Spotify playlist analyzer. In this analyzer we plan to implement a way to link 
your Spotify playlist to our analyzer, to return an analysis of the songs in your playlist by genre. We also 
plan to give a style rating to the user's playlist such as "happy" or "sad" depending on the vibe of the 
playlist. In addition to this we plan to implement a system that will create a list of recommendations with similar songs to their old 
playlist. We plan to host this program via a Streamlit pages website where people can copy and paste their spotify 
playlist link directly into the website.

# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

Our project is going to be a Spotify playlist analyzer. The features we intend to add are a basic analysis process that will show the percentages of each genre of your collective playlist and show them in a easy to view dashboard. In addition to this, we plan to use metrics such as mood/vibe to describe your playlist as a whole. For example, "happiness", "dancibility", "energy", "popularity", etc...

We will pull the data using Spotify's API and user credentials upon the user linking thier playlist to our web-hosted dashboard. The website will be made through streamlit, which hosts directly from the github repository. Streamlit is a python package where one can create a front-end dashboard. Streamlit community is a cloud hosting service that connects to your github repository and hosts web-apps for free. 

Once the website is being hosted we plan to add a recommendation system where the program will make a playlist for you based on your previous playlist. This is an idea we plan to implement after our analysis and web hosting is up and running. This playlist will be pushed back to the user account for their listening.  

# Anticipated Technologies

(What technologies are needed to build this project)

* Python - Packages include Pandas (data-analysis tools), Plotly (graphing) 
* Streamlit (python package and community cloud)
* Spotify API (Spotify developer account)

# Method/Approach

(What is your estimated "plan of attack" for developing this project)
* Gaining access to the Spotify API
* First make the connection between the Spotify API and the user's playlist
* Pull the songs from the user's account
* Preforming our genre analysis, and mood metrics
* Display the data on the dashboard using Streamlit
* Host the web-app using Streamlit community



# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)
* Installing libraries, gaining access to the Spotify API - Oct 8th
* Make the connection between a user playlist via user credentials and the Spotify API - Oct 15th
* Pulling the user songs - Oct 22nd
* Preform genre analysis and mood metric analysis - Oct 29th
* Display the metrics on the dashboard - Nov 5th
* Host the website using Streamlit community / making the front end - Nov 12th
* Core project concepts completed and website online - Nov 22nd 



# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
* We may encounter problems with connecting to the API
* Making the user interface look user-friendly (on all devices)
* Creating and pushing a playlist back to the user account
